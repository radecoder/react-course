ðŸ“Œ React ?
   - react is Javascript library for building user interfaces
   - because react uses js in the browser to update page (like click on tab and see video without reloading in an app ) 
     and user interface we see on that page without reloading the page,
   - js controls UI & content
ðŸ“Œ why to use React ? 
   -> it offers a simple mental model
ðŸ“Œ But then why we need React library as everything done by js ?
   - because complex js code quickly become error prone
   - complex code hard to maintain or edit   
   
ðŸ”¹ CodeSandbox ?
