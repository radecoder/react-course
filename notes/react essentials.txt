Why Are Components Useful?
🧩 Reusability:
You can create a button once and use it everywhere without writing the same code again.

🔍 Easy to Understand:
If your code is divided into small pieces (components), it’s much easier to understand and work with.

🔄 Easy to Update:
If you want to change the header design, you only change it in one place, and it updates everywhere.

🎯 Organized Code:
Your code is cleaner and more organized. Each component does only one thing.

⚙️ Better Performance:
Only the components that need to update will change, not the whole page.
