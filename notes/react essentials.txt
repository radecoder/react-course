Why Are Components Useful?
🧩 Reusability:
You can create a button once and use it everywhere without writing the same code again.

🔍 Easy to Understand:
If your code is divided into small pieces (components), it’s much easier to understand and work with.

🔄 Easy to Update:
If you want to change the header design, you only change it in one place, and it updates everywhere.

🎯 Organized Code:
Your code is cleaner and more organized. Each component does only one thing.

⚙️ Better Performance:
Only the components that need to update will change, not the whole page.



📌 Understanding Files
🔹index.html is responsible for diplaying content, and it contains index.jsx file
🔹 index.jsx file importing App.jsx file , and index.jsx file used App as JXS code (<App/>)
   and this index.jsx file act as main entry point of our App
   and createRoot and render method are responsible for rendring a single root component
🔹 App.jsx file contains all contents of our website

📌Component Function -> must starts with uppercase Character and shoud have return statement

📌How React handles components ?
- if we inspect our web we see index.html file,having script tag which have index.jsx that transformed into code that run in browser  
- (see index.jsx) 
- the App Component may contain many nested component as needed (App -> 1. Header 2. SideBar 3. Product 4. Footer)
   and are analyzed by React, and React combines all JSX code to generate overall DOM
- these custom components are not showing in actual rendered DOM , there are default html elements like (<header></header>)

📌Component -> are 2 types 1.Build-in Components  2. Custom Components
1.Build-in Components -> lower case like div , img 
2. Custom Components -> UpperCase like App, Header, SideBar
